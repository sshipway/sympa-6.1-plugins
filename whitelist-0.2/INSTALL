Whitelist/Modlist Extension for Sympa

Steve Shipway, University of Auckland, 2012

This adds Whitelist and Modlist functionality to Sympa, by using an included
scenario, and a TT2 module to hold the required Perl code.

Installing:

NOTE: Your installation may use different directories to hold the various
files.  Change the paths to what is appropriate for your system.

1. Copy UOA_whitelist.pm to /usr/share/sympa/lib/Template/Plugin , making the
   necessary subdirectories if you have to.  This is the sympa 'lib' path,
   where you find the various List.pm and so on.
   This module extends the TT2 parser to add the new functions to handle
   managing the whitelist and modlist files.

2. Create default empty whitelist.txt and modlist.txt files in 
   /etc/sympa/search_filters (or wherever your Sympa search_filters path is).
   These must exist as a default for lists that do not have a defined whitelist
   or modlist.

3. Install the whitelist.tt2 and modlist.tt2 into /etc/sympa/web_tt2
   These are the admin pages for the whitelist and modlist.  They go into
   your web_tt2 customisation directory.

4. OPTIONALLY copy modindex.tt2 into /etc/sympa/web_tt2.  This adds buttons
   to the moderation page for 'add to whitelist' and 'add to modlist'.

5. Update nav.tt2 on your system.  Copy your default file
   /usr/share/sympa/defaults/web_tt2/nav.tt2 into /etc/sympa/web_tt2 and then
   edit it to add the 'Whitelist' and 'Modlist' tabs.  The supplied nav.tt2
   should work with Sympa 6.1.x but if you have already customised nav.tt2
   you should make sure to add the necessary Whitelist and Modlist parts.

6. Copy include.send.header into your /etc/sympa/scenari directory.  This
   activates the Whitelist and Modlist on all lists, though until you define
   some entries, all lists will get the default empty files you set up in
   step 2.

7. Restart the Sympa daemons, and restart your web server.  This will pick up 
   the changes.

8. TEST!  Choose a list and verify that the Whitelist and Modlist tabs appear 
   in the admin page.  Try adding an entry to the whitelist and verify that 
   it works and produces no errors.

Caveats:

The new white/modlist admin pages are in English and do not have translations.
You might be able to update them yourself to help with this.

Make sure file ownerships are correct.

The future:

This patch has been submitted to the Sympa team as a proposed upgrade, and it 
is likely to be added to Ver 6.2.x eventually.  For now, this solution works
well.
