Sympa Message Tracking System
Version 0.1

Summary
-------
This is a mod for Sympa.  It is based on Sympa 6.1.11 but should work on any of the 6.x branch.

It provides functionality allowing you to track message views and link click-throughs on messages sent via a Mail-Merge-enabled Sympa mailing list.

This is an initial version, so more reporting functionality should be forthcoming in later versions.

This requires a small patch to the Sympa Bulk.pm module; hopefully, in later versions of Sympa, this will no longer be necessary.
