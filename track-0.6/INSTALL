Sympa Mail Tracking v0.1

How to Install
--------------

Note that different people will have installed files into different locations.  In this example, I will use the locations where we have installed, but your system may be different.

Install Files
-------------
track.cgi
This is the redirect script that handles the actual tracking
Edit this to have the correct database credentials for the Sympa database (find these in the /etc/sympa.conf)
Copy this file to /var/www/cgi-bin (your web server /cgi-bin) and ensure it can be accessed through the web by everyone.

tracking.tt2
This is the web template for the Sympa stats interface
Copy this file to /etc/sympa/web_tt2 (your sympa base web_tt2 directory)

help_tracking.tt2
This is the help page for the web interface.
Copy this file to /etc/sympa/web_tt2 (your sympa base web_tt2 directory)

Tracking.pm
This is the TT2 Plugin that does all the work.
Copy this to /usr/share/sympa/lib/Template/Plugin (under your Sympa perl library directory).  You may need to create the Template/Plugin directory under lib, if it does not yet exist.

Patch Web Template
------------------
nav.tt2.part
This is the additional sections for the nav.tt2 to add the new Tracking tab.
Copy your /usr/share/sympa/default/web_tt2/nav.tt2 (default nat.tt2) to /etc/sympa/web_tt2 (base web_tt2 dir) if it is not already there.
Edit your /etc/sympa/web_tt2/nav.tt2 to make the changes as in nav.tt2.part.  These changes are
a) Change the IF statement to add the extra criteria, and
b) Add the extra tab at the end of the <ul>
See nav.tt2.example for a modifed default nav.tt2, if you have not made any other changes to nav.tt2 on your system

Patch Bulk.pm
-------------
Bulk.pm.patch
This adds functionality to Bulk.pm so that incoming message headers are added to the TT2 stash, allowing the tracking to obtain the Message ID.  It is required for things to work.
This is applied to the file /usr/share/sympa/lib/Bulk.pm (in your Sympa perl library).  MAKE A COPY OF THE FILE FIRST!  I MEAN IT!
If you have the'patch' command, run "patch /usr/share/sympa/lib/Bulk.pm Bulk.pm.patch" and it should say "Patch succeeded".  
This patch is for Sympa 6.1.11, so may not work with later versions.  If it does not work, then you can apply it manually.  Edit the Bulk.pm file, and find the 'sub merge_msg'.  After the MIME::Entity test, add the new code
    $data->{'headers'} = {} if(!defined $data->{'headers'});
    my $headers = $entity->head;
    foreach my $key ( qw/subject x-originating-ip message-id date x-original-to from to thread-topic content-type/ ) {
        $data->{'headers'}{$key} = $headers->get($key) if($headers->count($key));
    }

Create Database Tables
----------------------
tables.sql
This contains the SQL to create the tracking tables in the Sympa database.
You may wish to edit this SQL, for example to change the database engine or encoding character set.  This is only tested against MySQL but with modification should work on any other database backend that supports subselects.
Run this SQL against your Sympa database, which should create the required three tables.

Test
----
To test, create a new mailing list and enable merge_feature on the list.
When logged in as list owner, editor or listmaster you should see a new tab, Tracking, in the Admin page.

Add a test user to the list.  Send a message to the list containing at least the following:

[% USE Tracking %]
[% Tracking.base %]
[% FILTER Tracking %]
This is a link <A href=http://www.sympa.org/>http://www.sympa.org/</A>
[% END %]
Message Ends

If you have installed correctly, the message should be delivered to the list.  
If a blank message arrives, this is probably a TT2 error.  Check your TT2 code and that the Tracking.pm file was correctly installed.  Check your sympa.log for TT2 errors.

When the message is distributed, check that the link has been changed to something like http://yourserver/cgi-bin/track.cgi/ABCD/1

In the Sympa web interface, click the Tracking tab, and you should see the message listed.  You can view the details for the message and links within it.

Open the message in your mail reader.  If you have image download, this should register the read in the Tracking page.  Click on the link and you should be sent to the Sympa website, but the link click count will increase in the Tracking page.
